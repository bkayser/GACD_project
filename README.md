# Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project

In this repo you will find a script for generating a tidy data file
called `summary.txt` as well as the [codebook markdown file](./CodeBook.md).

The script called [run_analysis.R](./run_analysis.R) expects to find the data from the UCI Machine Learning Repository project
_Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones_.  The data will appear in the folder `UCI HAR Dataset` when unzipped from archive found [here](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/00240/UCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip).

The analysis script will write a file called `summary.txt` whose structure and format is 
described by the [accompanying codebook](./CodeBook.md).
